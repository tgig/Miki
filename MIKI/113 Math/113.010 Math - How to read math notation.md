# How to read math notation

There are some things I never learned (or forgot) about math, starting very simple, like how to read notation.

## `P(H)`

```
P = probability
H = hypothesis
P(H) = probability that the hypothesis is true
```

In the case of Bayes Theorem (and maybe others?), `P(H)` is called the "Prior"

```
E = evidence
P(H|E) = probability that the hypothesis is true GIVEN THAT the evidence is true
```
- Probability of getting a result from `POP(1)` given the relative size and percent of `POP(1)` vs `POP(2)`
- The vertical bar says "GIVEN THAT". It LIMITS the view
- Also called the LIKELIHOOD

## $$\propto$$

Something like this:

$$P(\theta | \Upsilon) \propto P(\Upsilon | \theta)P(\theta)$$

Reads like:
- Probability of theta given upsilon **is proportional to** the probability of upsilon given theta times the probability of theta.
